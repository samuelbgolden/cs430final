CS430 Final Project

GENERAL INFO:
Chose to work independently, and chose to implement the MST algorithm. Built in Python with GUI Library TkInter. I have
also included some images of the application working in this folder in case there is some weird visual cross-platform
bug. The matrix input box is a little picky; entries in the same row must be separated by a single space ' ', and lines
should be separated by online a newline '\n'. There CANNOT be a trailing newline character on the last row.

BUILD INFO:
Because Python comes with TkInter standard, running this project should be as simple as navigating into the directory
with the two files and running 'python core.py'. This was written in python 3.8, so it is possible that having a python
installation at 3.8 is necessary, but I didn't use anything new to that installation, so I imagine earlier versions are
fine.
